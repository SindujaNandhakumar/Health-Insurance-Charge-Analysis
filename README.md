# Health Insurance Charges Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project explores a health insurance dataset to identify which personal and lifestyle factors most strongly influence individual medical charges. The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that simulate how insurance companies and healthcare stakeholders might assess risk and set fair premium rates.

Using Python and data visualization tools, the analysis focuses on demographic features (age, sex, region) and health indicators (BMI, smoking status, number of dependents) to understand patterns and segment customers based on risk.

##  Objectives

- Understand the relationship between medical charges and factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
- Segment individuals into groups (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers, BMI categories,Age group) to compare healthcare costs.
- Identify high-risk profiles that contribute disproportionately to insurance charges.
- Generate visual insights that support healthcare cost prediction and customer profiling.

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes 1,338 records with the following features:

| Column     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `age`      | Age of the primary beneficiary |
| `sex`      | Gender of the insurance holder |
| `bmi`      | Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²) |
| `children` | Number of dependents covered |
| `smoker`   | Smoking status (yes/no) |
| `region`   | U.S. region (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest) |
| `charges`  | Individual medical insurance charges (USD) |


##  Key Findings

- **Smokers** are billed significantly higher medical charges than non-smokers.
- **Obese individuals** tend to have higher healthcare costs.
- **Age** has a strong positive correlation with insurance charges.
- **Region and gender** showed relatively minor influence on charges.
- **High-risk profiles** (older, obese smokers) contribute disproportionately to total costs.

## Business Implications

- Insurance companies can better **assess customer risk profiles** using features like BMI and smoking status.
- **Preventive health strategies** can be targeted toward high-risk groups.
- Pricing models can be **optimized to reflect data-driven cost dynamics**.
- Policymakers can design **awareness campaigns** focused on smoking and obesity.
